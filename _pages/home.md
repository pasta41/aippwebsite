Artificial Intelligence, Policy, and Practice (AIPP) is an initiative housed within the <a href="https://cis.cornell.edu/">Bowers College of Computing and Information Science</a> at Cornell University. We approach AI as a fundamentally socio-technical phenomenon, one that must be understood with both normative depth and technical precision. We combine technical, sociological, philosophical and legal expertise and methods, in order to more fully understand and more wisely develop the future path and impact of AI. We aim to contribute to — and engage with — researchers, policymakers, and practitioners.
